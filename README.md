### Installation

  This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

  scikit-learn
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  seaborn



### Project Motivation
For this project, I am using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from kaggle to better understand:

  1.What is the most popular month for rentals in Seattle?
  2.What is the highest/lowest month for listing in Seattle?
  3.What are the attributes associated with the price?

### File Descriptions
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

### Results

- Based on the finding above, we found out that the top 3 popular months for airbnb in Seattle are August, September then July, which indicates that late summer and early fall is the most popular season. 
- Also, July, August and June have the top 3 highest listing price, which meets the popular season.
- Using the linear model we built, listing price is mainly associated with the location and room type.
- More findings can be found at the post.
