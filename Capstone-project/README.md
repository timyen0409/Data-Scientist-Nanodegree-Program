- pandas
- numpy
- json
- math
- matplotlib
- sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split module)
- sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler)
- sklearn.tree (DecisionTreeClassifier)
- sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier)
- sklearn.metrics (mean_squared_error,classification_report)
- sklearn.linear_model (LogisticRegression)
- sklearn.svm (SVC)
- datetime (datetime)
- sklearn.model_selection (GridSearchCV)

### Project motivation
This project is the Capstone project of my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity. As students in the nanodegree, we have the option to take part in the Starbucks Capstone Challenge. For the challenge, Udacity provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

Starbucks provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app once every few days. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

In this project, I analyzed a data set that contains the actions of each customer for different types of offers in the Starbucks mobile app, and build a machine learning model that can predict whether the customer will complete the offer.

### Result
